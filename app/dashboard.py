"""Streamlit dashboard: enter a username, get explainable, values-aware picks.

Run with ``make dev`` (``streamlit run app/dashboard.py``). This surface is the
**demo world**, always: it renders the fixture catalog so it works with no API
key and no account. Live data has a home since FIX-01, but it is the CLI's
(``lavender ingest --user`` then ``lavender recommend --user``), not this one's — a
Streamlit script re-runs top to bottom on every interaction, and holding the
cache connection a live source needs across those re-runs is a change to make
deliberately rather than as a side effect of wiring ingest.

Accessibility: the values lens is a labelled, always-visible, explained slider;
identity is shown as text + glyph (never colour alone); the score chart is paired
with a data table; sources render as real links. The committed static render
(:mod:`app.build_static`) carries the same semantics for the automated a11y gate.

Two interactive features sit on top of the core:

* **"Why this artist"** — each card surfaces the shared
  :class:`~recommender.why.WhyThisArtist`: the sourced identity (with provenance,
  never inferred) plus the hybrid + values-lens reasons.
* **Playlist export** — download a portable track list (text/CSV/M3U/JSPF) with no
  account, or connect Spotify (env-configured OAuth) to push a real playlist.
