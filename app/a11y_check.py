"""A dependency-free, offline checker for the mechanical WCAG 2.2 AA subset.

This is the fallback a11y gate when a browser-based runner (pa11y/axe) is not
available in the environment. It is intentionally conservative — it only asserts
things that are unambiguously checkable from static HTML — and ``make a11y``
prefers pa11y when it is installed. Run as ``python -m app.a11y_check FILE...``;
exits non-zero on any violation.

**It reports what it examined, per rule family, on every run.** Until #139 it
printed ``a11y: 0 violations`` and nothing else, which is the same sentence over
a page with twelve interactive controls and over a page with none. The audited
artifact is the second kind: ``app/render.py`` emits no ``<button>``,
``<input>``, ``<select>``, ``<textarea>`` or ``<form>`` at all, so every rule
that only has something to say about a control ran over nothing and reported a
pass. Meanwhile ``app/dashboard.py`` — the primary UI — builds twelve
interactive widgets that Streamlit renders at run time and that no gate in this
repository reaches. That was disclosed in README conformance row 6 and in
``tests/test_e2e_a11y.py``'s docstring; neither is reachable from the gate's own
output, and a green line is where a reader meets this.

So three rules hold here, and they are the point of the file:

1. **A family that examined nothing is never a pass.** It reports
   ``not_applicable`` with a written reason, because "no findings" and "no
   inputs" are otherwise byte-identical verdicts.
2. **Each family declares exactly one of a floor or a reason.** A floor says
   the audited page must have inputs here, so a render that stops emitting
   tables — or a selector that stops matching — fails instead of passing on
   nothing. A reason says having none is legitimate, and states why. Neither is
   optional and both cannot be set at once; ``tests/test_a11y.py`` holds the
   table to that.
3. **A floor is structural, never the current count.** Every floor here is 1.
   A floor equal to today's number is a hand-maintained counter, and this
   portfolio has repeatedly jammed its own merge queue on those.

This checker deliberately judges **no** interactive control. It has no
accessible-name, label-association or focus-order rule, because the surface it
audits has never contained a control to judge. That is a real limit rather than
a passing verdict, so it is printed as one — and it is self-limiting in the
direction that matters: a document that *does* contain a control is refused
outright (see ``_CONTROL_TAGS``), because a gate reporting on controls it cannot
judge is exactly the defect this file was rewritten to stop reporting.
