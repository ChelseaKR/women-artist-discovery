"""The one HTTP seam the identity enrichers fetch through.

Egress posture (RESPONSIBLE-TECH-AUDITS §C, FIX-07): sanctioned network access
lives in a named, allowlisted module, never scattered across the code that
happens to need a payload. ``pipeline/lastfm.py`` owns the listening-data
transport; this module owns the *identity-source* transport (MusicBrainz,
Wikidata). Both are listed in the egress registry
(``docs/audits/privacy-notes.md``) and in ``tests/test_privacy.py``'s
``NETWORK_ALLOWED``, which is what keeps that registry honest.

Keeping the transport here — rather than importing ``requests`` inside
:mod:`pipeline.enrich` — has a second payoff: every enricher takes its fetcher
as a constructor argument, so the whole parse/resolve path is unit-testable
from recorded payloads with no socket involved.

Three obligations this fetcher discharges on every call:

* **Identify ourselves.** MusicBrainz requires a descriptive ``User-Agent`` with
  contact information and rate-limits (or blocks) clients that omit one.
* **Pace ourselves.** One request per second by default, via the same
  :class:`~pipeline.lastfm.RateLimiter` the Last.fm client uses.
* **Ask once.** Every response is written to the local HTTP cache, so a re-run
  costs nothing upstream. This is a courtesy requirement, not an optimisation.
