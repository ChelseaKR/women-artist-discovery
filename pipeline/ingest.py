    :class:`~pipeline.enrich.MusicBrainzEnricher` reads a gender claim straight
    out of the MusicBrainz payload, while a P91 orientation claim needs a second
    fetch of the Wikidata entity, and ``_json`` renders any failure there as

    carrying a fresh gender citation and nothing on the queer axis — which
    ``_is_sourced`` reads as "upstream answered", writes, and thereby erases the
    P91 citation the operator's ingest paid for. ``diff_identity_sources`` walks
    the *new* sources, so an emptied axis has nothing to report: the erasure
    would be silent, which is the exact pairing this module exists to refuse.

    So the protection is per axis. An axis that came back with *upstream*
    citations is written; an axis that came back with none keeps what the cache
    already held.

    "Empty" has to mean "empty of upstream citations" rather than literally
    empty, because the refresh path enriches with ``cache=cache``: the
    operator's corrections ledger is merged into the evidence, so a corrected
    artist's axis is never empty even when nothing at all came back over the
    wire (#112). Reading that as "the axis answered" defeated this guard with
    the very row it exists to protect alongside — and did it on precisely the
    artists someone cared enough to correct. Taking the cached axis drops the
    correction from the written row and nothing more: it lives in the ledger,
    and :func:`enrich_artist` re-applies it, still winning on priority, at the
    next enrichment.

    ``fetched_at`` still advances, and that is deliberate rather than an
    oversight: it is an artist-level claim that this artist was checked today,
    and this artist genuinely was. The finer truth stays exact because a
    preserved claim keeps its own :attr:`~pipeline.models.Source.retrieved_at`,
    which is the date that claim was last actually read.

    The source branch needs a vocabulary the dict branch does not, because it is
    the only one that can be *lied to by silence*.
    :class:`~pipeline.enrich.MusicBrainzEnricher` deliberately renders every
    upstream failure — a timeout, a 503, a malformed payload — as "no evidence",
    which is exactly what "upstream holds no claim about this artist" also looks
    like. On the *ingest* path that conflation is correct and conservative: both
    mean the artist stays first-class ``UNKNOWN``, and nothing is lost.

    On the *refresh* path it inverts. Here a cited label already exists, and
    writing back an empty re-enrichment would delete a citation the operator's
    ingest paid for — on the strength of a signal that cannot distinguish
    "Wikidata retracted the claim" from "we never reached Wikidata". A refresh
    run against a dead network would otherwise erase every sourced identity in
    the cache and report zero changes while doing it, because
    :func:`diff_identity_sources` walks the *new* sources and an empty set has
    nothing to report.

    So this type keeps the two apart. Only an artist that came back *carrying
    sources* is written; everything else is counted, named, and reported. The
    cost is that a genuine upstream retraction is not auto-applied — it surfaces
    in ``protected`` for a human to act on via the corrections ledger, which is
    the direction this project already errs in: a label is sourced or absent,
    never inferred, and never dropped on ambiguous evidence.

    The same reasoning runs **per axis**, not only per artist: an artist can
    come back carrying a fresh gender citation and nothing on the queer axis,
    and writing that whole object would erase a P91 claim on the strength of a
    signal that cannot distinguish "Wikidata retracted it" from "we never
    reached Wikidata". See :func:`_preserve_unanswered_axes`.
