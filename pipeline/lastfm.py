"""Last.fm scrobble/tag/similarity source, with rate-limit respect + caching.

Two implementations of :class:`ScrobbleSource`:

* :class:`LastfmClient` — the live HTTP client. It honours Last.fm's rate limit
  via :class:`RateLimiter` and caches every response in the local :class:`Cache`
  so repeat runs do not re-hit the API (legal/ops requirement). The actual
  network calls are excluded from unit coverage; the parsing they feed is tested.
* :class:`FixtureLastfm` — an offline, deterministic source built from a dict.
  Used by every test and by the dashboard's demo mode, so the whole system runs
  with no API key and no network.

**The API key.** Last.fm authenticates a read request with an ``api_key`` query
parameter — no header auth exists, and its docs reserve POST for write services
— so the credential is unavoidably part of the request URL. Two places that URL
must therefore never reach: the on-disk cache (see :meth:`LastfmClient.cache_key`)
and an exception message (see :class:`LastfmRequestError`). Both are asserted by
``tests/test_privacy.py``.
