"""A local pending-corrections list — the other half of "fix it at the source".

EXP-05's round-trip is: a provenance item is wrong or stale -> the reader
opens the pre-filled upstream edit link (:mod:`recommender.upstream`) ->
they file a *local* note of what they proposed here -> they make the real
edit on Wikidata/MusicBrainz themselves -> the next ``lavender refresh`` re-fetches
and reports the change (:class:`~pipeline.ingest.IdentityLabelChange`) ->
:func:`reconcile` clears the matching pending row.

This module never talks to a network. It is a small JSON file next to the
local cache (Quality §9's data-lineage discipline extended to corrections:
every row records what was filed, when, and against which citation).

**A filed row is never deleted without evidence (#70).** Reconciliation used to
match on ``(artist_id, source_kind)`` alone, so *any* change on that key cleared
the row — including a change where only ``retrieved_at`` moved and the asserted
value was byte-identical. The proposed value was never read. A person filed a
note saying a database had their gender wrong, and the next ordinary refresh
deleted it while reporting success. Now:

* a row is reconciled only when the value upstream now asserts **is the value
  that was proposed** (compared through the controlled vocabulary, so
  ``"female"`` reconciles a ``"woman"`` proposal);
* a date-only change is not evidence of an edit and reconciles nothing;
* a change to some *other* value marks the row **superseded** — it stays in the
  file, carrying what upstream now says, and is reported. Nothing vanishes;
* reconciliation runs only when an upstream source was actually consulted. The
  shipped ``lavender refresh`` is demo-only and queries nothing, so it reconciles
  nothing and says so, instead of reporting "reconciled N pending upstream
  correction(s)" with no upstream behind the word.
