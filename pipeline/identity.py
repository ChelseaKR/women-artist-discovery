"""The identity resolver: sourced-only, unknown-by-default, **no inference path**.

This module turns *permitted-source evidence* into an :class:`IdentityLabel`. It
deliberately offers no way to derive gender from a name, a voice, an image, or a
genre:

* :func:`resolve_identity` accepts only :class:`IdentityEvidence`, whose ``kind``
  must be a member of :data:`~pipeline.models.PERMITTED_SOURCES`.
* Evidence carrying a non-permitted source kind is rejected at construction
  (:class:`~pipeline.models.Source`), so nothing inferred can even reach here.
* The default return is :data:`~pipeline.models.UNKNOWN_IDENTITY`.

The companion guardrail test (``tests/test_no_inference.py``) statically asserts
that no forbidden basis exists and that this resolver's signature exposes no
name/voice/image/genre input.

    * **By host** — any citation pointing into a known registry has to be an
      address that registry can resolve. This is what catches the shape the demo
      shipped for its two ``DISCOGS_LINEUP`` claims (``/artist/big-thief``):
      exempt from the by-kind layer, and pointing at a registry that addresses
      artists by numeric id.
