"""Independent synthetic-world builders for the eval (FIX-06: de-circularize).

``pipeline.demo``'s own docstring admits its world is "tuned so the hybrid
recommender recovers genuine held-out discoveries". Useful as a smoke test and
as the dashboard's demo mode — but as the *only* quantitative evidence in
``docs/audits/eval-report.json``, grading the recommender on a fixture built to
make it pass is circular.

This module factors the demo-world construction pattern (seeds/candidates/
scrobbles/similarity graph -> a temporal-split-able world) into a small,
declarative builder, and uses it to add four more worlds with genuinely
different structure:

* :func:`indie_tuned_world`       — (a) the existing, hand-tuned demo world.
* :func:`sparse_tags_world`       — (b) most artists carry empty/single tags;
  the content signal is weak almost everywhere.
* :func:`popularity_skewed_world` — (c) a couple of mega-listener artists with
  zero relevance dominate the popularity baseline.
* :func:`no_collaborative_world`  — (d) the similarity graph is empty, so only
  the content (tag-cosine) signal can fire.
* :func:`adversarial_near_miss_world` — (e) popular decoys share a tag with the
  train profile (content near-misses) without the similarity edges the true
  discoveries have — designed to fool a naive tag-only ranker.

Every builder returns ``(username, scrobbles, catalog, source)`` — the same
shape ``pipeline.demo`` already yields to ``recommender.eval.evaluate`` — with
a nonempty temporal test split and at least one genuine ground-truth positive.
None of these four are tuned to make the hybrid win; only :func:`indie_tuned_world`
carries that caveat, and it is labelled as such in ``ALL_WORLDS``.
