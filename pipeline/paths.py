"""Where Lavender Rotation stores its local data (FIX-12 — operability: a
documented, stable data location instead of a cwd-relative ``data/`` folder).

Resolution order:

1. ``LAVENDER_DATA_DIR`` env var, if set to a non-empty value — always honoured,
   any OS. (``WAD_DATA_DIR`` is still read, deprecated, see below.)
2. Otherwise a platformdirs-style per-OS user-data directory, computed with
   the standard library only (no new dependency): ``~/Library/Application
   Support/lavender-rotation`` on macOS, ``%APPDATA%\\lavender-rotation`` on
   Windows, and ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/lavender-rotation`` (default
   ``~/.local/share/lavender-rotation``) elsewhere.

Both paths are absolute and independent of the process's current working
directory, so two shells started in different directories resolve to the
same cache (the bug this module fixes: ``pipeline/cache.py`` used to default
to the cwd-relative ``data/cache.db``).

**The rename migration.** This project was ``wad`` (women-artist-discovery)
until 2026-08-16. A rename that silently changed the data directory would
orphan an existing cache — on the maintainer's machine that was 95k scrobbles
and 450 enriched artists, hours of upstream fetching that nobody should have to
pay twice. So :func:`migrate_legacy_data_dir` moves the old directory to the new
name on first use, and the old env var keeps working. The move is a rename on
the same filesystem: fast, atomic, and reversible by moving it back. It happens
only when the new location does not exist yet, so it can never overwrite a real
cache, and never runs at all once the migration has happened.
