"""Reproducible run manifests, and a diff that names *why* a list moved.

The repository already guarantees seeded reproducibility inside one process. It
does not let a listener answer "why is this week's list different from last
week's?" without diffing terminal output by eye. A manifest makes each run a
citable artifact; :func:`diff_runs` turns the per-card rank-shift transparency
into a statement between two runs.

**Attribution is a claim, so it is made only where the record supports it.**
:mod:`recommender.hybrid` stamps three ranks precisely so that movement can be
separated by mechanism (#113): ``base_rank`` before the lens, ``lens_rank``
immediately after it, ``rank`` after the identity-blind serendipity pass and the
listener's ``hide_sourced_men`` subtraction. A diff that recomputed causes from
``rank`` alone would undo that and would look right while doing it.

So the diff decomposes each artist's movement into the three intervals the
pipeline actually recorded, and attributes a shift to a mechanism **only when
exactly one of them moved**. When more than one moved, the honest answer is
:data:`CAUSE_UNDETERMINED` with the candidates named — not whichever cause is
checked first. That case is the common one in real use: change the lens and add
a thumbs-down between two runs and no record can separate their contributions.

A shift whose base-rank interval moved is upstream of the lens, and three
different things live up there — the listening profile, the feedback ledger, and
the content filter's narrowing of the candidate pool. The manifest carries a
digest of each, so the same rule applies one level down: exactly one changed
means it is named, more than one means the cause is undetermined and the
candidates are listed.

**What a manifest holds.** Artist ids, names, the three ranks, the identity
segment and basis a run already computed, and the coverage and exposure figures
it already published. It never holds listening history, play counts, or an
inferred field: the profile, the feedback ledger and the filter appear only as
digests, which compare without disclosing. There is no slot for an identity a
source did not assert.
