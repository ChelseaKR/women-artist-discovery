"""Core domain models — where the project's hard guardrails live as invariants.

The README guardrails are enforced *here*, in the type system, not merely in tests:

1. Identity is **sourced, never inferred.** A non-``unknown`` gender cannot be
   constructed without at least one citation (:class:`Source`). There is no code
   path that derives gender from a name, voice, image, or genre — and there is no
   :class:`SourceKind` member that represents such a thing. ``woman`` includes
   trans women, explicitly: sourced self-identification is the only test, and the
   vocabulary deliberately contains no cis/trans distinction to draw.
2. ``unknown`` is **first-class.** It is a real :class:`Gender` member and the
   default for every artist. Downstream code must never penalise it; the re-rank
   layer is boost-only (see :mod:`recommender.rerank`).
3. **"Female-fronted" is band-composition metadata**, kept distinct from any
   individual's gender. It is a *tri-state, sourced* property on
   :class:`BandComposition`, never an inference and never a claim about a person.
   It is also **narrow**: it says only that a front-person's own sourced gender
   is ``WOMAN``. A band fronted by a sourced nonbinary artist is *not*
   "female-fronted" — nonbinary is never a subtype of woman here. The general,
   category-preserving fact is :attr:`BandComposition.sourced_front_genders`.
4. Every recommendation carries an :class:`Explanation` with non-empty signals,
   an identity basis, and the sources behind that basis.
