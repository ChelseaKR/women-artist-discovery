"""One versioned JSON document per invocation, and the schemas that describe them.

The project's guarantees are strongest when a machine can check them. "Unknown is
never down-ranked", "every pick has a why", "identity is never inferred", "the
tool contacts these hosts and no others" are asserted today by tests over Python
objects, which means a third party has to take them on trust: nothing they can
run from the command line reports them.

These documents make three of them externally checkable:

* ``recommend`` carries, per pick, the *basis* on which identity was established
  and the citations behind it. The schema has **no slot for an inferred value**:
  ``inferred`` is ``const: false`` and a sourced gender without provenance is a
  schema error, so a reviewer can run ``recommend --json`` and confirm the
  no-inference property structurally rather than by reading prose.
* ``export`` wraps whatever the chosen portable format already produces, so the
  envelope cannot carry a field the format does not. It adds only metadata:
  which format, how many entries, when.
* ``doctor`` reports the egress allowlist — the modules this project permits to
  open a socket and the hosts they reach — so a reader can see what the tool is
  allowed to contact without reading its test suite. It also reports
  ``upstream_checked``, because "no upstream failure" and "upstream not probed"
  are different findings and must not render the same.

Two shape rules, both the same rule:

* **Absence is a value, not a gap.** An unmeasurable share is ``null`` and never
  ``0.0``; an unknown identity is the string ``"unknown"`` and never a missing
  key. A consumer that sees a number always sees one somebody measured.
* **Per-document schema versions.** ``recommend``, ``export``, ``doctor`` and
  ``error`` each carry their own, because bumping one shared number would tell
  every consumer their contract had changed when only one document moved.

The schemas are generated from the definitions here rather than written beside
them, and ``schemas/*.schema.json`` is committed for integrators;
``tests/test_jsonout.py`` regenerates and compares, so a schema cannot drift
from the code it describes without failing a test.

Dependency-free by construction, validator included: this project ships one
runtime dependency and a JSON-schema library is not going to be the second.
:func:`validate` understands exactly the keywords these schemas use, and
:data:`SUPPORTED_KEYWORDS` is asserted against them, so the checker cannot go
quiet by ignoring one.
