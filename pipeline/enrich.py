"""Enrichment adapters: turn external metadata into *permitted-source evidence*.

Each parser validates the untrusted external payload before trusting it (security
posture: cache-poisoning resistance — RESPONSIBLE-TECH-AUDITS §F) and emits
:class:`~pipeline.identity.IdentityEvidence`, which the resolver alone turns into
labels. Parsers are pure and unit-tested from fixtures; live fetches are thin
wrappers excluded from coverage.

Provenance is preserved end to end: every emitted evidence carries the source
kind, a citation, and the fetch date.

Two implementations of :class:`EnrichmentSource`:

* :class:`FixtureEnricher` — offline, backed by pre-parsed evidence. Every test
  and the demo world use it, so the whole system runs with no network.
* :class:`MusicBrainzEnricher` — the live one (FIX-01). It reads MusicBrainz's
  ``gender`` field and, when the MusicBrainz record links to Wikidata, that
  entity's P21 claim. Both are public, citable, per-artist claims; neither is a
  bulk identity dataset, and nothing fetched here is ever redistributed
  (``docs/audits/identity-data-ethics.md``).

**Entity resolution is not identity inference, and is gated like it matters.**
Last.fm hands us an MBID for some artists and a bare name for the rest. Turning
a name into a MusicBrainz record is a *lookup*, not a claim about a person — but
a wrong lookup would attach a stranger's sourced gender to an artist, which is
the same harm the no-inference rule exists to prevent, arriving by a different
road. So :func:`parse_musicbrainz_search` accepts a match only when the record's
name is exactly the queried name and exactly one record qualifies. An ambiguous
name resolves to nothing, and the artist stays ``UNKNOWN`` — first-class, never
down-ranked, and honest about what we actually know.
