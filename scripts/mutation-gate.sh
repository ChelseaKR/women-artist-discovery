# Mutation-testing gate (CQ-47) over the two safety-critical modules:
#
#   * pipeline/identity.py   — sourced-never-inferred identity resolver
#   * recommender/rerank.py  — boost-only / never-penalise values lens
#
# For each module, cosmic-ray generates mutants, runs the FULL unit suite
# against every one (subprocess per mutant — identical semantics to a real
# `pytest` run), and the gate fails if fewer than 70% of mutants are killed
# (cr-rate --fail-over 30 == survival above 30% fails), per module.
#
# cosmic-ray is version-pinned inline, same convention as pa11y in ci.yml —
# not a dependency-group entry, so the lockfile stays scoped to tools the
# regular verify pipeline needs. `--no-project` keeps the tool env from
# touching the project's .venv; the test-command inside the configs uses
# .venv/bin/python explicitly (run `make install` first).
#
# NOTE: cosmic-ray's local distributor applies each mutation to the working
# copy of the target file and restores it afterwards. Run on a clean checkout;
# the guard below refuses to run if a target file has uncommitted changes so a
# crash mid-run cannot silently mix a mutant into your diff.
