"""Docs-figures: every figure the docs state about this repo, derived from the repo.

`scripts/check-readme-claims.py` (2026-08-04) closed one instance of a general
problem: README's "NNN tests at NN% coverage" sentence had drifted from 433 to a
real 501 with nothing to notice. Its own docstring, and `docs/ROADMAP.md`'s build
log for it, said what it was: the local fix, with "the M8 auto-stamp backlog item
is the systemic fix and **remains open**."

This is that item. The difference is not that more numbers are checked — it is
that a checked figure is now a *manifest row* rather than a script. Each
:class:`Figure` pairs one claim, located by a regex inside one named section of
one document, with the callable that re-derives it from the thing it describes.
Adding a gated figure is four lines in ``FIGURES``; nothing here knows what a
test count or a coverage floor *is*.

Two consequences worth stating, because they are the reason to prefer a manifest
over another bespoke guard:

* **It stamps, it does not only complain.** ``--write`` substitutes the derived
  value into the document. The old guard could only fail and ask a human to
  retype a number, which is the same hand-editing step that produced the drift.
* **A figure stated in several documents is one row per statement, one deriver.**
  The ``>=85%`` coverage floor is written in four places and lives in exactly one
  (``pyproject.toml``'s ``--cov-fail-under``). Raising the floor and updating
  three of the four is now a failing gate rather than a silent inconsistency.

**What is deliberately not gated.** A dated, point-in-time number inside a
historical record is not a claim about today, and rewriting one would falsify the
record. ``docs/ROADMAP.md``'s build-log addenda, ``docs/plans/*``,
``docs/USER-RESEARCH.md``'s persona quoting "108 tests @ 94%", ``CHANGELOG.md``,
and ``docs/ideation/*`` are all snapshots by design. Every row below therefore
names the *section* its claim lives in, so a figure can never be located by
accident somewhere the manifest did not mean; and a pattern that matches twice
inside its section is an error, never a first-match guess.

Run with no arguments to check (non-zero on drift, wired into ``make test``);
run with ``--write`` to stamp (``make stamp``).
