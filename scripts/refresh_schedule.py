"""Print the scheduler entry that runs `make refresh` on the recorded cadence.

`lavender refresh --user` closes the upstream-correction round-trip: it re-asks
MusicBrainz and Wikidata about cached artists and reconciles the pending ledger
against what actually came back. Until now nothing ran it on a schedule, so an
artist who corrected their own record upstream reached this project only when
somebody remembered to re-ask. That is a correctness gap, not a convenience one.

**Why this is not a GitHub Actions cron.** The thing being refreshed is a cache
of *your* listening history, in the platform user-data directory on *your*
machine (`pipeline/paths.py`). A hosted runner has no such cache; giving it one
would mean uploading a personal listening profile to CI, which contradicts the
local-first promise in `docs/audits/privacy-notes.md` and buys nothing. A
workflow that cannot reach the data it claims to refresh is worse than no
scheduler: it is a green checkmark for work that did not happen. ADR 0013
records the decision.

So the scheduler is the operator's own — launchd on macOS, cron elsewhere — and
this script renders the entry for *this* checkout so no path has to be typed by
hand. It writes nothing and installs nothing; installing a job that runs on your
behalf is a deliberate, human copy-paste.

**Credentials are never rendered into the entry.** A launchd agent under
`~/Library/LaunchAgents` is a plain file, and a crontab is readable by root and
by anything that backs up your home directory; an API key does not belong in
either. Both entries instead source a mode-600 env file that the operator
creates once. `tests/test_refresh_schedule.py` asserts no rendered entry ever
carries a credential value.
