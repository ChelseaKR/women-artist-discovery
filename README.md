# Women-Artist Discovery

**A demo-first music-discovery engine that surfaces new women, nonbinary, and female-fronted artists through an explicit values lens.** It combines collaborative and content signals with a sourced-identity re-ranker. Identity is never inferred, and "unknown" is a normal, first-class answer. The offline demo and pipeline are complete; wiring a real username through live enrichment into the app remains deferred work.

**Trans women are women here — explicitly.** The three terms in the tagline are not redundant; they cover three different shapes: *women* (solo artists whose sourced self-identification is woman — cis or trans, with no distinction drawn anywhere in the data model), *nonbinary* artists (represented as nonbinary, never folded into another category), and *female-fronted* (band-composition metadata: an act whose sourced lineup/role data shows a woman — cis or trans — fronting it, which is a fact about the band, never a claim about any individual). A trans woman artist whose self-identification is sourced is surfaced as a woman, full stop.

**Status:** `Beta` · **Track:** Personal (data/ML + small web app) · **License:** MIT · **Data:** personal/local

> **Build:** M0–M6 demo scope implemented. `make verify` runs formatting/lint/SAST,
> strict typing, 433 tests at 97% coverage, dependency and secret scans, three
> axe/pa11y renders plus browser-driven keyboard/reflow/reduced-motion specs
> (Playwright, required in CI), offline multiworld evaluation with

## Why it matters
Your library leans toward women and female-fronted bands by taste, but no recommender helps you lean into that on purpose without either ignoring identity entirely or guessing it crudely. Doing this *well* — sourced, transparent, non-essentialist — is the whole point and the interesting part.

## What it does
- **Builds listening profiles** from Last.fm-shaped scrobbles and tags; paginated/incremental client and cache paths are tested, while live app orchestration is still deferred.
- **Hybrid recommendations:** collaborative similarity + content/tags, then a values-aware re-rank.
- **Sourced identity, never inferred:** identity basis is shown and cited; woman means woman, cis or trans, with no distinction drawn; nonbinary is represented properly; unknown artists are surfaced on musical merit alone.
- **Explains every pick:** a shared "Why this artist" view — why (which signals) + identity basis + provenance (the *raw value each source asserted*, never inferred).
- **Export your picks:** push the current set to a Spotify playlist (env-configured OAuth), or download a portable, account-free track list (plain text / CSV / M3U / JSPF).
- **Local-first:** your listening history stays yours. Sanctioned egress is limited to explicit Last.fm fetches, opt-in upstream diagnostics, and user-initiated Spotify export (artist names only).

## For Claude Code
- **Build entrypoint:** [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](./docs/ROADMAP.md) → *Implementation Plan*.
- **Hard guardrails:** **never infer an artist's gender or identity from name, voice, image, genre, or any heuristic** — identity labels come only from cited self-identification sources (artist statement, sourced Wikidata P21 claim, MusicBrainz gender field) and must carry that citation; **woman includes trans women explicitly — sourced self-identification is the only test, and no cis/trans distinction exists anywhere in the vocabulary**; **"unknown" is first-class and must never reduce, down-rank, or drop a recommendation**; "female-fronted" is band-composition metadata (lineup/role), sourced not guessed, and kept distinct from any individual's gender; every recommendation must show why + identity basis + source; do not redistribute a scraped musician-identity dataset (minimize, cite, keep correctable).
- **Commands:** `make dev` · `make verify` · `make a11y` · `make eval`.
- **Current definition of done:** demo recommendations are explainable and reproducible, sourced identity is enforced, unknown is retained, and every local gate is green. Live username-to-recommendation orchestration is explicitly deferred in the roadmap ledger.

## Observability
**Tier C** — OTel tracing is out of scope for this local tool. The CLI configures
structured stage/timing logs, supports `--log-format json`, and `wad doctor`
reports local configuration/cache health with opt-in upstream probes.

## AI-evaluation status
In scope per `AI-EVALUATION-STANDARD.md` §0 as a classical-ML recommender: no LLM,
RAG, generation, or judge. Direct runtime dependency is `requests`; Streamlit/pandas
live in the app extra and test/audit tools live in the dev group. §1–3's
LLM/RAG/judge gates are dormant. The gate that **is** active and merge-blocking:
the offline eval must beat the popularity baseline (`make eval`, `docs/audits/eval-report.json`).
The first LLM SDK import anywhere in this repo flips this status to `APPLIES` in full and activates
§1–3. See `docs/RESPONSIBLE-TECH-AUDITS.md` for the full AI-governance picture.

## Standards Conformance
Inherits [`/STANDARDS`](../STANDARDS/). Per-standard declarations (Documentation Standard's
"a repo must declare Applies/N/A for every standard, not just inherit silently" rule):
