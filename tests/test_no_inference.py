"""THE guardrail test — written first, the centrepiece of the project.

The hard rule (README): *never infer an artist's gender or identity from name,
voice, image, genre, or any heuristic.* This test proves the inference path does
not exist, three ways:

1. **Vocabulary** — the permitted source kinds contain nothing name/voice/
   image/genre-derived, and there is no ``IdentityBasis`` for "inferred".
2. **Structure** — the resolver's inputs (``IdentityEvidence``) expose no name,
   image, audio, or genre field; its signature takes nothing forbidden.
3. **Code** — an AST scan proves no function in ``pipeline/`` reads a forbidden
   attribute (``genre``, ``tags``, ``voice``, ``image`` …) on any path that can
   reach an identity label.

Plus a behavioural proof: an artist with a feminine-coded name and a
"female vocalists" tag, but no identity evidence, resolves to UNKNOWN.

Mapped to the merge-blocking metric: *Inferred identity labels = 0*.

**Leg 3 was rewritten by #72.** It used to walk a hardcoded list of four
function names in one file. ``pipeline/identity.py`` defined seven functions, so
three were unscanned — including one added the week before — and nothing
asserted the list covered the module. A helper that mapped genre tags to a
gender, called from ``resolve_identity``'s unknown fallback, passed the scan.
The scan is now defined by three properties, each asserted here rather than
assumed:

* **Total.** Every ``def`` and ``async def`` in every ``pipeline/*.py`` module is
  walked. There is no allowlist to fall off.
* **Exemptions are named, justified, and live.** A function that legitimately
  handles tags (``ingest.enrich_artist`` builds an ``Artist``'s content tags) is
  listed in :data:`TAG_HANDLING_EXEMPTIONS` with a reason. A stale entry naming
  a function that no longer exists fails, so a hole cannot be pre-drilled.
* **Exempt is not unguarded.** Exempt functions are held to a *stricter* check:
  a taint walk asserting no value derived from a forbidden read ever reaches an
  identity constructor (``resolve_identity``, ``IdentityEvidence``, …).

And two structural facts the old scan assumed: ``recommender``/``app``/``export``
construct no identity objects at all (so an inference path cannot simply move
there), and the scan itself is proved to *fail* on the exact bypass #72
demonstrated.
