"""No-identity-in-logs gate (OBS-11) — the no-inference invariant extends into
the log stream.

The diagnostic channel must never become an identity channel: log lines may
carry stage/timing/count/id data, never identity vocabulary or per-artist
identity values. Two legs, mirroring ``tests/test_no_inference.py``:

1. **Behavioural** — run the logging-heavy demo pipeline end to end with every
   ``lavender.*`` record captured, format each record with *both* shipped
   formatters (kv and JSON), and assert no identity vocabulary appears anywhere
   in the stream.
   *That capture is only as wide as the namespace.* It attaches a handler to the
   ``lavender`` root logger, so a module logging under some other name is not
   observed by this leg at all — which is exactly what happened:
   ``pipeline/paths.py`` logged to ``wad.paths`` from the rename until
   2026-08-28, outside the captured tree and outside the stderr-only handler
   ``configure_logging`` installs. A third leg below closes that by deriving
   every logger name from the source.
2. **Structural** — an AST scan over every logging call site in ``pipeline``,
   ``recommender``, ``app``, and ``export`` proves no call passes an
   identity-bearing name, attribute, or literal.

If a future change legitimately needs to log an identity-*adjacent* aggregate
(say, a coverage count), it must be reviewed and the vocabulary below adjusted
deliberately in the same PR — that friction is the point of the gate.
