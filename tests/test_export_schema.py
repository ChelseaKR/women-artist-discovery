"""R9: no identity field may appear in any export format.

An export is the project's one egress. To stay true to "never build a misusable
musician-identity database," what leaves must be *only* artist names + a non-identity
reason — never a gender, a basis, or a provenance citation. These tests assert that
structurally (the schema of every format) and by content (the rendered bytes), using
the demo world, which deliberately contains women, nonbinary, and female-fronted
artists — so any leak would show.

**Extended for ADR 0011's second axis.** This module is named, by name, in
`recommender.lens.QUEER_LENS.harms_note` ("identity never leaves the machine —
no export carries it, tests/test_export_schema.py") and in ADR 0011's
Consequences as one of the defences that became *load-bearing* once the repo
started holding orientation and trans data. It was written before that axis
existed and checked for none of it: no `queer`, no `orientation`, no `p91`, no
`lesbian`, no `trans`. Worse, the demo world carries no sourced queer artist at
all, so even a token list naming those words would have had nothing to observe
— the guard could not have fired on the most sensitive field in the repo.

Two things fix that here. The forbidden vocabulary is *derived from
``Orientation``* rather than hand-listed, so a member added later is covered
without an edit; and :func:`_queer_world` builds a world that actually contains
a sourced queer, trans artist, so the content assertions have a real leak to
find. That artist is invented (`tests/test_live_enrichment.py` gives the
reason): asserting an orientation or a trans self-identification about a real
person, even in a fixture, is exactly what this project refuses to do.
