"""The committed ruleset must not be a lockout waiting to be applied.

`docs/audits/branch-ruleset.json` is a declarative GitHub ruleset, and ADR 0001
described it as a target to be posted by hand with `gh api -X POST`. It carried
`"bypass_actors": []` from the day it was written, and ADR 0001 argued for that
emptiness on purpose: "not even the repository owner/admin can merge around the
ruleset ... an empty `bypass_actors` list is sufficient". That reasoning is
wrong. GitHub accepts such an apply with a 201, and the result is a `main` that
the owner cannot merge to, push to, or unblock, because unblocking it means
editing the ruleset that is doing the blocking. It is not hypothetical: applying
a no-bypass ruleset elsewhere in this portfolio took a recovery sweep across
eighteen repositories.

Correcting the file once is not the fix, because the file can regress. This
module is the fix: the empty list, and the four neighbouring ways to lose the
bypass, are now test failures.

The checks fail closed, in the same spirit as `tests/test_no_inference.py`:
`lockout_risk` is a pure function of a parsed document so it can be run against
documents it must reject as well as against the committed one, and
`load_ruleset` treats a missing or unparseable file as a failure rather than
returning an empty document the assertions below would read as "nothing wrong".
A guard that passes when its subject is absent is the defect it exists to catch,
and the parse is what catches it: a truncated file still contains the literal
string `bypass_actors`, so a grep would wave it through.
