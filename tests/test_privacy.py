"""Privacy audit §C: no telemetry, and network egress confined to one place.

These are source-level guarantees (DPIA: data-minimisation + purpose-limitation):
the listening data is local-first, so the core must not import analytics SDKs and
must not open network connections anywhere except the explicit Last.fm/enrichment
and Spotify-export client paths.

This is enforcement gate 1 of 2 for FIX-07 (runtime egress guard, see
`docs/audits/privacy-notes.md` "Egress registry / allowlist"): a source-level
scan that catches string-level egress additions in `app/` and `export/` as well
as `pipeline/`/`recommender/`. Gate 2 is the autouse socket-level guard in
`tests/conftest.py`, which catches indirect/transitive runtime egress that a
text scan can't see.

# `export/base.py` replaced `export/spotify.py` here when the second provider adapter
# landed (#54): the one live HTTP transport moved into the shared seam, so the export
# half of this allowlist got SHORTER as providers were added instead of growing one
# entry per provider. A new adapter that needs its own socket has to change this line.
#
# `pipeline/http.py` joined it when live enrichment landed (FIX-01) — the fourth and,
# by the same seam discipline, last entry the identity path needs: MusicBrainz and
# Wikidata are both fetched through that one transport, and `pipeline/enrich.py`
# takes its fetcher as an argument rather than importing a client of its own.
# Imported, not restated. The allowlist is shipped code now, because
# `lavender doctor --json` publishes it and a reader should not have to open a
# test file to learn what this tool may contact. A second copy here would be a
# second place for it to drift.
