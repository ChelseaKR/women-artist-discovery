"""#71 — the committed `docs/audits/dashboard.html` must match what the code renders.

`docs/audits/` is the project's public evidence drawer. `.gitignore` names the
a11y dashboards as committed deliverables (unlike regenerable churn such as
`coverage.xml`), the README's Standards table links there for the accessibility
claim, and the audit notes name that render as what was audited. It is browsable
on GitHub.

Nothing regenerated it and nothing checked it. `make a11y` runs
`python -m app.build_static`, which **overwrites** the file and then audits the
fresh copy — destroying the evidence before looking at it — and
`tests/test_e2e_a11y.py` builds into a tmpdir, so the merge gate never touched
the committed copy either. On `main` it had drifted far enough to display three
MusicBrainz citations that do not locate a record, plus their matching `/edit`
links, under artist names next to gender claims: the exact defect PR #66 fixed,
still on public display in the committed artifact.

This is the issue's **Option A** — gate the artifact, keep the "browse the
audited page on GitHub" affordance. It runs in `make test` (stage 3), before
`make a11y` (stage 5) has a chance to overwrite anything, and the Makefile no
longer regenerates the committed file as a side effect of auditing it.

# --- The renderer's own CLI, which `make a11y` is built on -------------------

# `make a11y` does not call `build()`; it shells out to
# `python -m app.build_static --scheme light --out ...` and again for dark, and
# the Makefile's comment claims that makes the gate "scheme-complete on any
# machine — a Dark-Mode Mac and light-mode CI check the same two palettes".
# That claim rests entirely on `main()` forwarding `--scheme` to `build()`.
# `tests/test_contrast.py` proves the *renderer* honours a scheme; nothing
# proved the CLI passes one along. A `main()` that dropped the argument would
# write two byte-identical "pinned" renders, pa11y would audit the same palette
# three times, and every gate would stay green.
