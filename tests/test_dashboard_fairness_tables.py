"""The Streamlit dashboard's two fairness tables, built and read without a Streamlit runtime.

**This file exists because nothing rendered them.** `tests/test_committed_render.py` holds the
*static* render (`app/render.py`) to the byte, and `tests/test_observability.py` holds the panel
`app/dashboard.py` reads. Between those two the dashboard's own table construction was
unexercised, so when `segment_retention` started reporting `None` for an absent segment (#129)
and `app/render.py` was taught to say so, the interactive dashboard was left formatting a value
that no longer existed:

    TypeError: unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__

on the **demo world**, which is the only world that dashboard ever shows. `mypy --strict` could
not see it: the expression carried a ``cast("dict[str, float]", ...)`` asserting a type the value
had stopped having, and a cast is a promise the checker takes at its word.

So the tables are built by named functions now, and these tests call them over the real demo
world rather than a fixture shaped to be convenient.
