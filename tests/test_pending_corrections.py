"""Local pending-corrections store (EXP-05): the local half of the round-trip.

local note -> upstream edit (human, out of band) -> a refresh against a real
upstream source observes the *proposed value* -> `reconcile()` clears the row.

The middle step is load-bearing and used not to be checked (#70). `reconcile()`
matched on `(artist_id, source_kind)` alone, so a refresh that moved only a
retrieval date deleted a person's filed note while reporting success. The test
below that "verified" this — `test_reconcile_drops_matching_row_and_keeps_others`
— passed a change whose `old_value` and `new_value` were byte-identical, against
a row whose `current_value` and `proposed_value` were also identical, and
asserted the row was dropped. It pinned the defect as correct behaviour. It is
rewritten here to assert the absence of the harm instead: a filed row is never
removed without evidence that upstream now asserts what was proposed.
