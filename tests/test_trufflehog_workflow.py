"""The scheduled secret scan must stay capable of failing.

Three properties of `.github/workflows/trufflehog.yml` are asserted here, because
each one has silently un-armed a secret scan in this portfolio and none of them
shows up as a red build when it breaks:

1. **The result tiers include `unverified`.** TruffleHog sorts a finding into
   `verified` (it authenticated the credential against the live service),
   `unknown` (verification errored) and `unverified` (it asked, and the service
   said no). A credential that leaked and was later *revoked* — the normal end
   state of a real leak, and the exact case a scheduled full-history sweep
   exists to catch — answers "no" and is therefore `unverified`. A scan
   configured `--only-verified`, or `--results=verified,unknown`, cannot fail on
   it. Measured 2026-09-06 on a throwaway clone of this repository with a
   real-shaped AWS key planted in one commit and deleted in the next:
   `--results=verified` exited 0 reporting nothing; the widened tier exited 183.

2. **The action ref and the `version:` input name the same release.** The
   `version:` input is what selects the scanning binary
   (`ghcr.io/trufflesecurity/trufflehog:${VERSION}`); the `uses:` SHA pins only
   the wrapper. Dependabot edits `uses:` and never a `with:` input, so the two
   drift apart and each "upgrade" is a no-op that reads like one. This
   repository was in exactly that state: the ref said v3.95.8 while the scanner
   downloaded 3.96.0.

3. **`fetch-depth: 0` survives on the checkout.** Without it `actions/checkout`
   fetches a single commit, and a "full-history" sweep becomes a one-commit scan
   that still reports success.

The workflow's pin comment is a YAML comment, so it is invisible to a YAML
parser: these assertions read the file as text on purpose.
