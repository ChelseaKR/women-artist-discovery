"""R1: the per-run identity-coverage readout makes 'unknown is first-class' visible.

The readout is purely descriptive — it reports what the pipeline already computed
and must never reframe the (common, expected) unknown case as a failure, nor feed
any score. These tests pin both the arithmetic and the honest framing.
