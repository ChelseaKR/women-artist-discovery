"""The docs-figures manifest: its locator, its stamp, and its live rows.

`scripts/docs_figures.py` replaced `scripts/check-readme-claims.py`, which
checked one sentence. The thing worth testing about the replacement is not that
it can compare two integers — it is that the *locator* refuses to guess. A gate
whose regex silently matches nothing passes forever; one that silently matches
twice and then rewrites the first hit falsifies a document. Both are tested here
as errors, because both are how an auto-stamp goes wrong.

The two subprocess-backed derivers (`pytest --collect-only`, `coverage report`)
are deliberately not exercised here — they are thin I/O wrappers, they are run
for real every time `make test` reaches its stage-3 gate step, and calling them
from inside the suite would mean the suite counting itself. That is the same
convention the repo already applies to `scripts/writeup-check.py`. The
file-backed derivers *are* checked against the live documents below, so a stale
figure fails the suite and not only the Makefile step.
