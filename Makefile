# Dependency-audit waivers (SECURITY-AND-SUPPLY-CHAIN-STANDARD §4 "Unfixable
# HIGH/CRITICAL waiver — committed, justified waiver JSON").
# As of the Python 3.10+ migration (2026-06-30) the waiver list is EMPTY:
#   * RR-4 — the 19-advisory Python-3.9-EOL cluster (requests, urllib3, streamlit,
#     pillow, pyarrow, msgpack, filelock, pytest, pip) had fixes gated to
#     Python >=3.10; with the floor now >=3.10 every fix installs (see
#     pyproject floors + uv.lock), so all 19 IDs are dropped.
#   * RR-1 — GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph (pip fallback tar extraction) is cleared by
#     pip>=25.3 / PEP 706 tar filter on the >=3.10 floor; no longer reported.
# `pip-audit` is therefore driven to 0 with NO --ignore-vuln flags. Re-introduce a
# justified entry here (byte-identical in ci.yml + docs/audits/vex.json) only if a
# genuinely-unfixable advisory ever appears. History: docs/audits/residual-risk.md.

# Regenerating the *committed* artifact is deliberately NOT part of `a11y`

# committed page is browsable on GitHub and the README's Standards table links
# to it, so a silent drift is a claim about a build that no longer exists.

# Stage 7 as `verify` runs it. `eval` above writes the report straight into the
# working tree, which is why it could not be the gate: it regenerates the right
# numbers, throws the comparison away, and replaces the committed bytes.
#
# Measured on 2026-08-29 against this branch's parent. One metric in
# docs/audits/eval-report.json was edited to 0.0001. `git status` showed the
# file modified. `make eval` exited 0. `git status` came back empty with the
# file restored, and nothing was said. A stale committed report therefore could
# not fail anywhere, CI included, because CI runs `make verify` on a clean
# checkout and this same writing target overwrote the evidence before anything
# looked at it.
#
# scripts/writeup-check.py runs here rather than only in `audit`. It reads
# docs/audits/eval-report.json at a fixed path, so running it after `eval` only
# ever compared methods.md against a file written seconds earlier, which says
# nothing about the artifact the repository publishes. Running it after the diff
# compares methods.md against the committed report, which the diff has just
# proved is what the pipeline produces. `audit` still runs it too.
#
# `diff` exits 0 identical, 1 different, above 1 when it could not look. The
# three are kept apart, because a gate that reports success for having failed to
# run is the failure this target exists to fix.
