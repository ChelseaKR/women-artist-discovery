"""Deep links to the *upstream, human-facing edit UI* for a sourced citation.

Part of EXP-05 ("Fix it at the source"): when a provenance item is wrong or
stale, the honest fix is to correct it at the source it came from, not to
quietly override it locally. This module is a pure, egress-free mapping from
a :class:`~recommender.why.ProvenanceItem` (or the
:class:`~pipeline.models.Source` it mirrors) to the edit page a person can
open in their own browser.

Guardrails, mirrored from the identity invariant (README / CONTRIBUTING):

* **String parsing only, no network.** This module never fetches anything —
  it only recognises the shape of a citation URL this project already
  produces and rewrites it to the corresponding edit surface.
* **Never an auto-edit or API-write link.** Only the ordinary, human-facing
  edit UI is linked — Wikidata's own page (anchored at the relevant
  statement) or MusicBrainz's `/edit` form. There is no code path here that
  writes to an upstream source; a person always reviews and submits the edit
  themselves.
* **No guessing.** A citation that doesn't parse, or a source kind with no
  defined upstream edit surface (e.g. a Discogs lineup page has no single
  canonical "edit this claim" URL we can safely construct), returns ``None``
  rather than fabricating a link that might be wrong or misleading.

      the safe choice: Wikidata does not honour a query-string that opens an
      edit form pre-filled for a specific claim, so this anchors the reader at
      the right statement on the entity page instead of fabricating one.
    * ``wikidata-p91`` — the same entity page, anchored at the P91 ("sexual
      orientation") statement (#92). ADR 0011 admits P91 for coverage while
      noting it is more often a biographer's characterisation than the artist's
      own words, which makes it the citation here most likely to *need*
      correcting — and it was the one kind with no edit link at all, so the
      fix-at-source affordance existed for every claim except the one most
      likely to be wrong.

      ``artist-statement`` whose citation is somebody's own website, or a
