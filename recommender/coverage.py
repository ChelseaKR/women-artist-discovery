"""Per-run identity-coverage readout — make 'unknown is first-class' *visible*.

The re-rank already knows, for every pick, whether its identity is **sourced**
(an individual self-identification, or a sourced band lineup)
or **unknown** (surfaced on musical similarity alone). This module turns that
already-computed fact into one honest, render-agnostic readout —
"N of K picks carry a sourced identity; M were surfaced on similarity alone" —
so a guarantee that is *mechanically true in code* (unknown is never down-ranked,
never dropped) is also **legible** in the product.

Two framing rules are baked in so the readout can never curdle into a scorecard
that pathologises the common case:

* **Unknown is first-class.** It is described as "surfaced on musical similarity
  alone" — a normal, expected outcome — never a gap, a miss, or a failure. Source
  data is sparse (well under half of people on Wikidata carry a sex/gender claim),
  so a high unknown count is the *expected* state, not a defect.
* **Descriptive, not target-driven.** Nothing here feeds a score or a re-rank; it
  only *reports*. The numbers never change a recommendation.
