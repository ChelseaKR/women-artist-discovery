"""Build the human-readable explanation attached to every recommendation.

Every recommendation must show *why* (the signals), the *identity basis*, and the
*source* of that basis (README + Transparency audit §D). The summary is honest
about unknown: an unknown artist is described as "surfaced on musical similarity
alone", never apologised for and never hidden.
