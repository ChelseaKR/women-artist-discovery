"""``LensSpec`` — the values lens as a declared, inspectable object.

Before this module, "what does the values lens boost, and why" was answered by
reading constants scattered across ``recommender/rerank.py`` and
``pipeline/models.py``. :class:`LensSpec` collects that into one manifest — an
aligned predicate over *sourced* fields only, a boost bound, and human-readable
rationale + harms text — so the dashboard, tests, and future lenses can all
introspect the same object instead of re-deriving its meaning.

**The ``Gender.OTHER`` question, decided explicitly.** ``Gender.OTHER`` is a
*sourced* self-identification outside the common vocabulary (e.g. intersex,
third-gender terms) — see :class:`pipeline.models.Gender`. This lens's aligned
set (:data:`VALUES_LENS.aligned_genders`) does **not** include it. That is a
deliberate choice, not an oversight, for one reason: ``OTHER`` is a
heterogeneous bucket covering disparate identities that were never unified by
the act of sourcing them, and folding it into "aligned with a women-and-
nonbinary lens" would make an unstated value claim on those artists' behalf
about which lens they belong to. Excluding it keeps the lens's stated purpose —
surfacing women and nonbinary artists — from silently expanding to cover
identities it was never scoped to represent. This is a revisable decision: a
dedicated lens for artists sourced as ``OTHER`` (or a broader "sourced marginalized
gender" lens that explicitly opts them in) is a legitimate future LensSpec, but
that is a new manifest with its own rationale and harms note, gated on an
identity-data-ethics review — not a silent addition to this one. See
``docs/audits/identity-data-ethics.md`` for the recorded decision.

**This is a re-rank concern, never a penalty.** Exactly like ``UNKNOWN``,
``Gender.OTHER`` is simply not in the aligned set: it receives zero boost and
keeps its exact base score. It is never down-ranked, never excluded from
results, and never treated differently from ``UNKNOWN`` by the scoring math —
see :mod:`recommender.rerank` for the boost-only invariant that makes this
mechanically true.
