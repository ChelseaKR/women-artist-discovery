"""Hybrid recommender: combine collaborative + content, then apply the values lens.

The base score is a convex blend ``alpha * collaborative + (1 - alpha) * content``,
each signal min-max normalised across candidates so neither dominates by scale.
Optional, artist-scoped thumbs feedback applies a bounded nudge to that base
score; it never reads or generalises across identity.
The values lens is then applied **boost-only** (see :mod:`recommender.rerank`),
followed by an optional identity-blind serendipity/diversification pass over the
movable candidates (see :mod:`recommender.diversify`). The full list is
reconstructed around the rank-protected slots — unknown and sourced-``OTHER``
artists, see :data:`recommender.rerank.RANK_PROTECTED_GENDERS` — before top-k is
selected, and every result is explained.

At ``lens_strength = 0`` and ``explore = 0`` (both defaults) the output is the
pure-taste hybrid ranking — which is what the offline eval compares against
the popularity baseline.

Every recommendation carries three ranks, and the difference between them is
load-bearing (#113):

* ``base_rank`` — its counterfactual position in the pure-taste ordering
  (``lens_strength = 0``), recorded *before* the lens is applied.
* ``lens_rank`` — its position immediately after :func:`recommender.rerank.rerank`
  and before anything else runs. This is the only rank that reflects the values
  lens and nothing else.
* ``rank`` — its displayed position, after the identity-blind serendipity pass
  and after the listener's ``hide_sourced_men`` subtraction.

The why-card's rank-shift sentence names the lens, so it is computed from
``base_rank -> lens_rank`` (:mod:`recommender.why`). It used to be computed from
``base_rank -> rank``, which absorbed all three mechanisms and attributed every
one of them to the lens — including at ``lens_strength = 0``, where the lens
provably did nothing. Serendipity running *after* the counterfactual is recorded
is exactly why its movement lands in ``rank - base_rank``; recording the
counterfactual earlier does not separate the causes, stamping a rank between the
stages does.

    the shipped women/nonbinary one by default, or the queer lens (ADR 0011).
