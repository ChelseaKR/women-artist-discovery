"""Hybrid recommender: combine collaborative + content, then apply the values lens.

The base score is a convex blend ``alpha * collaborative + (1 - alpha) * content``,
each signal min-max normalised across candidates so neither dominates by scale.
The values lens is then applied **boost-only** (see :mod:`recommender.rerank`),
followed by an optional identity-blind serendipity/diversification pass (see
:mod:`recommender.diversify`), and every result is explained.

At ``lens_strength = 0`` and ``explore = 0`` (both defaults) the output is the
pure-taste hybrid ranking — which is what the offline eval compares against
the popularity baseline.

Every recommendation also carries a ``base_rank``: its counterfactual position
in that pure-taste ordering (``lens_strength = 0``), computed *before* the lens
is applied. This lets every why-card say, in plain language, how the lens moved
a pick — see :mod:`recommender.why`. Serendipity reordering happens after this
counterfactual is recorded, so it cannot be misattributed to the values lens.
