"""Per-recommendation thumbs feedback — a bounded, artist-scoped ranking nudge.

M6 "Should": let a listener thumbs a specific recommendation up or down and have
that opinion tune *future* rankings, without reopening the identity-fairness
guarantee the values lens depends on (:mod:`recommender.rerank`).

The mechanism is deliberately narrow:

* **Artist-scoped, never identity-scoped.** A vote is keyed to one
  ``artist_id``. :func:`feedback_adjustment` only ever folds in votes whose
  ``artist_id`` matches the artist being scored — a thumbs-down on one artist
  can never lower any other artist, let alone a whole identity class. Identity
  never appears in this module at all.
* **Bounded, like the lens's boost.** Votes are summed and squashed through
  ``tanh`` so the signal saturates rather than growing without bound, then
  scaled by :data:`MAX_FEEDBACK` — the negative-capable counterpart of
  :data:`recommender.rerank.MAX_BOOST`. The result always lies in
  ``(-MAX_FEEDBACK, MAX_FEEDBACK)``.
* **Composed into the base (taste) score, not the lens delta.** The lens's
  ``rerank_delta`` stays boost-only and non-negative (its own invariant,
  tested in ``tests/test_rerank.py``); feedback instead nudges
  ``base_score`` in :func:`recommender.hybrid.recommend`, before the lens is
  applied and the list is re-sorted. That keeps "the lens never penalises
  unknown identity" and "feedback can raise or lower one artist" as two
  independent, non-interfering guarantees.
* **Deterministic.** Pure function of ``(artist, feedbacks, strength)``; vote
  order and repetition don't matter beyond their sum.
