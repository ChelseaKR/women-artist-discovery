"""Computed exposure & rank-fairness metrics for the values lens (FIX-05).

Turns the fairness *narrative* (``docs/audits/fairness-identity.md``) into
*generated numbers* committed to ``docs/audits/eval-report.json``. Nothing here
infers gender: every segment is read from an artist's **sourced** identity (or
sourced band composition). The residual ``unknown`` segment is first-class and is
the subject of the merge-blocking retention guarantee below.

Metric choices (short justification, per FIX-05's requirement):

* **Exposure@k** — the *count-based* share of the top-``k`` recommendation slots a
  segment occupies. It is the simplest, most legible allocation measure; we report
  it per lens strength so the lens's re-allocation is visible. (Attention-weighted
  exposure — discounting lower ranks — is a defensible alternative; we prefer the
  unweighted share because the list is short and every surfaced slot is seen.)
* **Unknown-retention@k** and **other-retention@k** — the fraction of pure-taste
  ``unknown`` (resp. sourced-``OTHER``) artists in the evaluated top-``k`` whose
  score, top-``k`` presence, and rank are preserved as the lens strengthens.
  Both are *verified on emitted output*, not inferred from a boost-only score
  formula — see :func:`assert_unknown_retained` and :func:`assert_other_retained`.
  The ``OTHER`` measure exists because #68 found the lens's published harms note
  promising it and nothing checking it.
* **Rank-shift** — the mean change in list position per segment relative to pure
  taste (lens 0). Aligned artists re-order only the unpinned slots; ``unknown``
  and sourced-``OTHER`` slots stay pinned to their pure-taste positions
  (:data:`recommender.rerank.RANK_PROTECTED_GENDERS`), so the lens's
  re-allocation lands on sourced men. Nothing here softens that: it is what the
  ``man`` row of ``mean_rank_shift`` reports.
* **Popularity-tier x identity** — cross-tabs the candidate pool by listener count
  (:attr:`~pipeline.models.Artist.listeners`), surfacing the "lens over-favours
  already-popular women" allocational risk named in ``fairness-identity.md`` §3.
