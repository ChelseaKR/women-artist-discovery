"""Identity-blind content filters: tags and era, and nothing else.

A discovery tool that can only say "more of what you already play" goes stale — which is what
``--explore`` exists for. This is the other half a listener needs: "post-punk", "not country",
"since 2015". Those are questions about the *music*, and this module can only answer questions
about the music, by construction.

**Why a separate module from :mod:`recommender.filters`.** That module holds
``is_sourced_man_only``, which reads a sourced gender claim on purpose. This one must never read
anything of the kind, and the strongest available guarantee of that is the whole-module AST scan
:mod:`recommender.diversify` already lives under: every function in the file, every attribute it
touches, checked against the forbidden set. Two modules is what makes that scan applicable here;
putting these predicates in ``filters.py`` would have forced the guard down to a per-function
allowlist, which is a weaker promise and a maintenance trap. See
``tests/test_no_inference.py::test_content_filters_never_read_a_forbidden_attribute``.

**Why absence never excludes.** An artist with no tags, or with no known start year, is *kept* by
every filter here. This is the same rule that governs identity: an absent claim is not a claim.
It matters more than it looks. Tag and year coverage upstream is thinnest for the least
documented artists, which on MusicBrainz skews small, new, and independent — the artists this
project exists to surface. A filter that dropped them for having no metadata would quietly
re-impose the popularity bias the whole ranking is built to resist, while looking like a neutral
content preference. So the rule is: a filter removes only on a *positive* match against a value
the artist actually has.

**Where they apply.** Before scoring, on the candidate pool. Everything downstream — the values
lens, rank protection, the serendipity pass, the base-rank and lens-rank counterfactuals — then
runs unchanged over whatever survived, and the rank-shift sentence on each card stays a claim
about the lens rather than about the filter (#113).
