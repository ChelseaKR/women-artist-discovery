# Project Scope

Last verified: 2026-07-11 · Recheck cadence: per docs change. Base branch: `main`.

This file is a plain-language map of the project as it exists on `main`. It does not replace the README, roadmap, audit docs, or source comments. It points to them so a reviewer can see the whole shape without reading every file first.

## What This Project Is

Women-Artist Discovery recommends music with an explicit values lens. It uses listening history and music metadata while keeping identity sourced, never guessed, and treating unknown identity as a valid answer.

Package metadata checked in this pass:

- Python package `women-artist-discovery` for Python `>=3.10`.

## Who It Serves

- A listener who wants music recommendations weighted toward women, nonbinary, and female-fronted artists.
- Maintainers building local-first recommender pipelines.
- Reviewers checking fairness, identity-data ethics, privacy, and export behavior.

## What It Covers

- Last.fm ingest, metadata enrichment, identity modeling, recommender logic, explanations, reranking, temporal profiles, per-artist feedback, exports, and dashboard rendering.
- Docs for roadmap, audits, ADRs, I18N, identity ethics, fairness, privacy, and residual risk.
- Eval reports, model cards, data cards, accessibility outputs, and AI risk notes.
- Tests for identity, privacy, adapters, reproducibility, export, eval, feedback, cache lifecycle, fairness observability, and accessibility.
- Spotify and portable playlist export paths.

## How It Is Put Together

- pipeline/ handles ingest, enrichment, identity, models, and cache behavior.
- recommender/ contains collaborative, content, hybrid, rerank, explanation, and eval code.
- export/ contains Spotify and tracklist outputs.
- app/ contains dashboard and static rendering.
- docs/audits/ records identity, fairness, model, data, privacy, and residual-risk notes.

Observed source and operations surfaces:

- `Makefile`
- `app/`
- `export/`
- `pipeline/`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `recommender/`
- `scripts/`

GitHub workflow files checked:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
- `.github/workflows/osv-scanner.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml`
- `.github/workflows/trufflehog.yml`
- `.github/workflows/zizmor.yml`

## Trust Boundaries

- Identity is sourced from cited self-identification or structured sources, never inferred from names, voices, images, or genre.
- Unknown identity must not lower the quality of a recommendation.
- The user controls egress; playlist export sends only what that export requires.

## Outside This Scope

- It is a personal recommender, not a universal fairness benchmark.
- Metadata sources can be wrong or incomplete.
- A scraped musician-identity dataset should not be redistributed from this repo.

## Validation Notes

For this docs PR, validation means the scope file was reviewed against the merged `main` metadata and docs inventory, checked with `git diff --check`, and passed through the repository verification suite. Project tests remain the authority for code behavior.
