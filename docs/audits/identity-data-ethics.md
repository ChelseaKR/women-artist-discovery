## Permitted identity sources (the *only* ones)

| Source | Establishes | Provenance | Known limits |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Wikidata **P21** ("sex or gender") | individual gender | QID claim + entity URL | sparse; occasionally wrong/out of date |
| MusicBrainz **gender** field | individual gender | editorial / self-reported | editorial; "Not applicable" → unknown |
| **Artist statement** (cited) | individual gender | public self-identification + citation | requires a real, linkable source |
| Discogs **lineup** / MusicBrainz **relationship** | band composition (who fronts) | lineup URL | composition only — never a person's gender |

These map 1:1 to `SourceKind` in `pipeline/models.py`. There is deliberately **no**
source kind for a name, voice, image, or genre. Code: `pipeline/identity.py`.

## Policies

- **No inference, ever.** Gender is read only from the sources above. Enforced by
  `IdentityLabel.__post_init__` (a non-unknown gender without an individual-source
  citation raises) and proven by `tests/test_no_inference.py` (vocabulary check +
  AST scan of the resolver + behavioural checks). → metric *Inferred labels = 0*.
- **Unknown is first-class.** Default everywhere; never penalised. See
  `fairness-identity.md` and `tests/test_unknown_first_class.py`.
- **Provenance is mandatory.** Every known label carries its citations + fetch
  date. `tests/test_provenance.py`. → metric *Labels with a cited source = 100%*.
- **Female-fronted ≠ a member's gender.** It is a sourced, tri-state band property
  (`BandComposition.female_fronted`), kept separate from any individual's label.
  `tests/test_identity_model.py::test_female_fronted_is_distinct_from_member_gender`.
- **Trans inclusion.** Trans women are women; trans men are men (Wikidata QID map
  in `pipeline/identity.py`). Intersex/third-gender are represented, not flattened.
- **Correctability.** Labels are cache rows keyed to a citation, and a cited local
  correction can override a stale claim. Automated re-reading of a corrected
  upstream source is not shipped because the CLI has no live enricher; corrupt
  rows that violate a guardrail still fail closed (`tests/test_cache_serde.py`).
- **Confidence is a tier, never a percentage.** `IdentityLabel.confidence` is an
  internal float used only to order/prioritise sources
  (`pipeline/identity.py::_SOURCE_BASE_CONFIDENCE`: 0.95 artist statement, 0.80
  Wikidata P21, 0.70 MusicBrainz gender); it is never rendered as a number. Any
  surface that shows identity confidence uses the qualitative tier vocabulary
  from `recommender/why.py::_confidence_tier`, derived from the actual citation:

  | Cited source | Rendered tier |
  |---|---|
  | Artist statement | "directly stated by the artist" |
  | Wikidata P21 | "recorded in Wikidata" |
  | MusicBrainz gender | "editorial database entry" |

  The numeric value cannot change the wording; no identity statement ever
  shows an unexplained number. → FIX-14.

## The values lens as a declared manifest (LensSpec), and the `Gender.OTHER` decision

The values lens is not a loose set of constants; it is a declared, inspectable
object: `recommender.lens.LensSpec` (fields: `name`, `aligned_genders`,
`max_boost`, `rationale`, `harms_note`), instantiated once as
`recommender.lens.VALUES_LENS`. `LensSpec.aligned()` evaluates the aligned
predicate over *sourced* fields only (an artist's sourced gender, or a sourced
female-fronted band composition) and `LensSpec.boost()` returns a bound,
non-negative boost — never a penalty. The dashboard renders the active lens's
`name` and `rationale` directly (`app/dashboard.py`), so "what does this lens
boost, and why" is answerable from the UI, not just from reading code.

**The `Gender.OTHER` question, decided explicitly.** `VALUES_LENS.aligned_genders`
is `{Gender.WOMAN, Gender.NONBINARY}` — it does **not** include `Gender.OTHER`.
This is a deliberate, documented decision, not an oversight:

- `Gender.OTHER` is a *sourced* self-identification outside the common
  vocabulary — a heterogeneous bucket that can include intersex people,
  third-gender identities, and other terms a source used that don't map to
  `WOMAN`/`MAN`/`NONBINARY`. These identities were never unified by anything
  other than "the vocabulary didn't have a better bucket for them."
- Folding that bucket into "aligned with the women-and-nonbinary lens" would
  make an unstated value claim on those artists' behalf — asserting they
  belong to a lens whose stated purpose (surfacing women and nonbinary
  artists) was never scoped to represent them.
- Excluding `OTHER` from this lens's aligned set keeps the lens honest about
  its actual purpose instead of silently expanding to cover identities it was
  never designed for.
- **This is revisable.** A dedicated lens for `OTHER`-sourced artists (or a
  broader "sourced marginalized gender" lens that explicitly opts them in) is
  a legitimate future `LensSpec` — but it is a *new* manifest with its own
  rationale and harms note, gated on a fresh identity-data-ethics review
  (this document), not a silent addition to the existing one.
- **This is a re-rank concern, never a penalty.** Exactly like `UNKNOWN`, an
  artist sourced as `Gender.OTHER` keeps its exact base score: zero boost, no
  down-rank, no exclusion. `tests/test_lens.py::test_lens_other_excluded` and
  `test_lens_other_is_not_penalised_like_unknown` lock this in.

## Non-redistribution

This repo ships **no** bulk musician-identity dataset. Identity is resolved
on-demand from upstream sources and cached locally only (`data/cache.db`, git-
ignored). MusicBrainz/Wikidata content is CC0 (attribution given); Discogs is used
under its API terms. The worst-case misuse — a scraped "gender of musicians"
dataset — is structurally prevented: there is no export of identity data and the
cache is personal/local. See `LICENSE` (data note) and `privacy-notes.md`.
