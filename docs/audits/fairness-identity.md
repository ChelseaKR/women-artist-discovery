## Segments

Artists are segmented by **identity basis** (self-identified / band-composition /
unknown), by **gender** within the self-identified set (woman / man / nonbinary /
other), by **sourced fronting lineup** (female-fronted / nonbinary-fronted — the
two band-composition segments this prose omitted while `recommender/exposure.py`
reported them), and by **popularity tier** (listener count). The exact segment
tuple is `recommender.exposure.SEGMENTS`: woman, nonbinary, female-fronted,
nonbinary-fronted, man, other, unknown.

## Risks & findings

1. **Representational — nonbinary erased / collapsed into a binary.**
   *Finding:* nonbinary is a first-class `Gender` member, resolvable from a sourced
   statement and boosted by the lens exactly like women. Proven end-to-end:
   `tests/test_identity_model.py::test_nonbinary_survives_end_to_end_in_recommendations`
   (a nonbinary artist appears in results with a boost and a correct explanation).

2. **Representational — unknown erased by the re-rank.**
   *Finding:* the lens is **boost-only** and treats pure-taste unknown positions as
   protected slots; an unknown artist's score and rank are invariant to lens
   strength, including after identity-blind exploration and at the evaluated top-k
   boundary. `tests/test_unknown_first_class.py` and `tests/test_exposure.py`. This is
   the project's central fairness guarantee.
   → metric *down-ranked-for-unknown = 0*.

3. **Allocational — the lens over-favours already-popular women.**
   *Mitigation:* the boost is bounded (`MAX_BOOST`, `recommender/rerank.py`) so it
   re-orders without erasing the taste signal, and the base score is taste-only
   (popularity is **not** an input to the hybrid — it is only the eval baseline).
   The demo eval shows the hybrid recovers held-out discoveries that the popularity
   baseline misses (`docs/audits/eval-report.json`).

4. **Men keep their score; they do not keep their position.** A sourced man keeps
   his exact base score under any lens strength — he simply receives no boost
   (`tests/test_rerank.py`,
   `tests/test_unknown_first_class.py::test_man_and_unknown_are_not_penalised_*`,
   and `recommender/exposure.py::assert_no_score_reduced` on emitted output). His
   *list position* can move down, because a boosted artist that rises has to pass
   someone and every other segment is rank-protected. That is the whole of this
   lens's re-allocation. Stated here, and in `VALUES_LENS.harms_note`, rather than
   described as "never a penalty" — which is what the note said until #68.

5. **Sourced `Gender.OTHER` is rank-protected too (#68, 2026-08-14).** Not being
   in the aligned set means zero boost; it does not mean displacement. Sourced
   `OTHER` artists hold their pure-taste position exactly as unknown artists do
   (`recommender/rerank.py::RANK_PROTECTED_GENDERS`), checked on emitted output by
   `assert_other_retained`. Before this, the re-rank pinned only unknown slots, so
   an artist with a *sourced* self-identification outside the lens's vocabulary
   could be ranked below a *lower-scoring* artist with no sourced identity at all.
   → metric *down-ranked-for-sourced-other = 0*.

## Measurement & visibility

Beyond the pass/fail gates above, two **descriptive** instruments report fairness
per run (deliberately not target-driven — they measure, they do not set quotas):

- **Identity-coverage readout** (`recommender/coverage.py`) — "N of K picks carry a
  sourced identity; M surfaced on musical similarity alone." Makes *unknown is
  first-class* legible in the CLI, the dashboard, and the committed static render,
  framing the (common, expected) unknown case as normal, never a gap.
  `tests/test_coverage_readout.py`.
- **Exposure / rank metric** (`recommender/exposure.py`) — top-k exposure share,
  unknown retention, mean rank shift by identity segment, and a popularity-tier
  cross-tab across a lens sweep, reported in `eval-report.json`. It shows what the
  bounded lens changes while separately enforcing that unknown **and sourced-`OTHER`**
  artists are never dropped from top-k, score-penalised, or moved to a worse rank,
  and that no artist of any identity loses score. `tests/test_exposure.py`,
  `tests/test_rank_protection.py`.
